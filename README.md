# SECRETS

This project is a simple Node.js application named Secrets. In this project, I utilized a website that utilizes the Secrets API to anonymously reveal people's deepest, darkest secrets.

This project was inspired by a real application called Whisper, which was quite famous a few years ago. Essentially, people share their secrets anonymously on the Internet, and it's quite interesting to read what they reveal without being identified.

I accessed random secrets using the Secrets API and Axios. Doesn't it sound really fun? ðŸ¤– In this project, I used the Node.js web application framework Express, EJS (a template language), and the Axios library, which I've been working with for a while.
